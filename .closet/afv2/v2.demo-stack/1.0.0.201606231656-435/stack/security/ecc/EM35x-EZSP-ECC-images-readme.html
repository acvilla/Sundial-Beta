</head><body>

<h2>EM35x EZSP images containing the ECC library</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
This release is meant to be used with EmberZNet 5.6.x release and contains the EZSP images for EM35x that are built with the ECC Library from Certicom 
<br>
<br><i><b>Software Versions</b></i> <br>
<li>stack software -- please refer to the (stack) release note for the build number
<li>ECC Library - version 1.0.1.20

<br>
<br><i><b>EZSP images</b></i><br>
EM35x EZSP images provided support all optional libraries, including both 163k1 and 283k1 ECC.  See the table at the end of this document for a description of these optional libraries.  EBL files can be loaded using the bootloader or em3xx_load - the tokens are not erased during the load.
<br>
<br>
<li><b>ncp-spi-use-with-ezsp-spi-btl-ecc-5.6.0.ebl</b> -- This image is for use with a SPI connected host.  Can run as any type of ZigBee device.  This image is intended to be run with the ezsp-spi bootloader (found in tool/bootloader-em35x directory as part of stack installer).  The image for em357, em357-ncp-spi-use-with-ezsp-spi-btl-ecc-5.6.0.ebl, uses a 32KB SimEEPROM - it supports 100 binding table and link key table entries each, as well as 32 user storage tokens (for use with ezspSetToken()).
<li><b>ncp-spi-with-ezsp-spi-btl-ecc-5.6.0.hex</b> -- This image is for use with a SPI connected host.  Can run as any type of ZigBee device.  This image includes ezsp-spi bootloader.  The image for em357, em357-ncp-spi-with-ezsp-spi-btl-ecc-5.6.0.hex, uses a 32KB SimEEPROM - it supports 100 binding table and link key table entries each, as well as 32 user storage tokens (for use with ezspSetToken()).
<li><b>ncp-uart-rts-cts-use-with-serial-uart-btl-ecc-5.6.0.ebl</b> -- This image is for use with a UART connected host using hardware flow control (RTS/CTS).  Can run as any type of ZigBee device.  This image is intended to be run with the serial-uart bootloader (found in tool/bootloader-em35x directory as part of stack installer).  The image for em357, em357-ncp-uart-rts-cts-use-with-serial-uart-btl-ecc-5.6.0.ebl, uses a 32KB SimEEPROM - it supports 100 binding table and link key table entries each, as well as 32 user storage tokens (for use with ezspSetToken()).
<li><b>ncp-uart-rts-cts-with-serial-uart-btl-ecc-5.6.0.hex</b> -- This image is for use with a UART connected host using hardware flow control (RTS/CTS).  Can run as any type of ZigBee device.  This image includes serial-uart bootloader.  The image for em357, em357-ncp-uart-rts-cts-with-serial-uart-btl-ecc-5.6.0.hex, uses a 32KB SimEEPROM - it supports 100 binding table and link key table entries each, as well as 32 user storage tokens (for use with ezspSetToken()).
<li><b>ncp-uart-xon-xoff-use-with-serial-uart-btl-ecc-5.6.0.ebl</b> -- This image is for use with a UART connected host using hardware flow control (XON/XOFF).  Can run as any type of ZigBee device.  This image is intended to be run with the serial-uart bootloader (found in tool/bootloader-em35x directory as part of stack installer).  The image for em357, em357-ncp-uart-xon-xoff-use-with-serial-uart-btl-ecc-5.6.0.ebl, uses a 32KB SimEEPROM - it supports 100 binding table and link key table entries each, as well as 32 user storage tokens (for use with ezspSetToken()).
<li><b>ncp-uart-xon-xoff-with-serial-uart-btl-ecc-5.6.0.hex</b> -- This image is for use with a UART connected host using hardware flow control (XON/XOFF).  Can run as any type of ZigBee device.  This image includes serial-uart bootloader.  The image for em357, em357-ncp-uart-xon-xoff-with-serial-uart-btl-ecc-5.6.0.hex, uses a 32KB SimEEPROM - it supports 100 binding table and link key table entries each.
