# Description of the plugin.
description=This plugin provides support for testing the network throughput of your application. This testing can be done with up to four packets in flight, with one sent per application tick. The plugin will notify your application to send a message via emberAfPluginThroughputSendPacketCallback, and in turn your application must notify the plugin when the message has completed its trip by calling emAfPluginTrafficNotifyPacketReceived. For example, if you wish to test the number of Read Attributes commands you can send within some time frame, you would implement the emberAfPluginThroughputSendPacketCallback to contain the code to form and send the Read Attributes command to some target node, and then implement the emberAfReadAttributesResponseCallback to contain a call to emAfPluginTrafficNotifyPacketReceived.
