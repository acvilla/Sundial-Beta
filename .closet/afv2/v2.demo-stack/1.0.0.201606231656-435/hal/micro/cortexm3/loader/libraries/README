These libraries used to be generated separately from the main 3xx tools, but
now they're generated automatically by buildscript.sh.  They come from ZNet, so
you'll need to have that in your workspace view.  Please see the previous
version of this file in Perforce for a discussion of the old manual way of
building things.
